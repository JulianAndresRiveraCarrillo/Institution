The project was made to help educative institutions who are willing to improve the organizational efficiency of their information through software. It can be used by
the academic section of the institution, going from the students to the director, giving them different levels of access and different functionalities. 

For the development of the project, every tool learned in the first and second course of algorithms and programming was used. The .zip file is divided in eight packages, 
each one of which contains a different aspect of the project. There's a package for the miscellany(images,data) of the project, other one for the components of the user 
interface, another one for the files that control the user interface, other one for the threads that are used in the project, other one for the files that test the project, 
another one for the exceptions designed by the authors, and the last one for the core code of the project.


For the instalation of the program, if you're using a .zip file, you should:
	1. Decompress it
	2. Open your IDE in the workspace in which you have the file
	3. Import the project
	4. Run the project
